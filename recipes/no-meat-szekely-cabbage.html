        <p>
            This dish is called <em>“Székely”</em> meaning “Transylvanian” but 
            interestingly it is not named after the Transylvanian region but 
            someone in <em> Hungarian history </em> the 1800-s whose surname was 
            “Székely” (József Székely, writer) and who is credited with 
            inventing the dish when asking  for the meaty paprika stew,
             porkolt and sour cabbage mixed together when dining out.
